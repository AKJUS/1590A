Note: Tayda drill 'Y' is opposite from KiCad 'Y': Tayda Y is positive
going up, KiCad Y is positive going down.

Tayda is also "zero at center" for all coordinates, while KiCad is zero
at upper left.

This is Tayda coordinates.  Everything in mm, and this is the "maximum
holes" version.  I don't think you can reasonably fit any more, but you
could certainly do fewer knobs and/or drop the mini-switch.

Sizes include paint clearance, and can have alternate smaller uses (ie
the sub-mini switch only wants a 5.2mm hole, but the hole is sized so
that you could instead replace it with a second LED for rate information
or something like that.  Similarly, the 7mm holes for pots can be used
for the "regular" mini switches that only need 6mm holes).
